This mini application uses Postgresql (DB), NodeJS(Server-side), and AngularJS(client-side)
Style wise, I wrote the app to remain compact and left comments to a minimum.  If there are any questions about the code feel free to contact me at <tony.broomes@gmail.com>

The database and schema has already been created.  If you want to start with a fresh database, run

    node db/database.js 

from the project root


In order to run the application, run the command

    npm start 

from projects root directory.

You can also void individual serial numbers by using the checkbox.  It will remove the serial number immediately.
